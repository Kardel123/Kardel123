# Web Development Technologies Overview

This profile demonstrates the basic usage and integration of four fundamental web technologies: PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below is a quick overview of each technology, along with their respective logos.

## Technologies Included

### HTML - Hypertext Markup Language

HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides the structure of web content by defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and forms.

- **Usage**: Defines the structure of web pages.
- **Basic Syntax**: Elements are written using tags. For example, `<h1>Heading</h1>` for a heading or `<p>Paragraph</p>` for a paragraph.

### CSS - Cascading Style Sheets

CSS is used to style and format the layout of web pages. It controls the design of the web page, including aspects like colors, fonts, spacing, and the overall positioning of elements.

- **Usage**: Defines the visual appearance of HTML elements.
- **Basic Syntax**: CSS is written in selectors and declarations. For example, `p { color: blue; }` changes the text color of paragraphs to blue.

### JavaScript

JavaScript is a dynamic programming language used to create interactive and responsive web pages. It allows for the manipulation of HTML and CSS, handling events, and making asynchronous requests to servers.

- **Usage**: Adds interactivity to web pages.
- **Basic Syntax**: JavaScript code is written in statements and functions. For example, `alert("Hello, World!");` shows a pop-up message in the browser.

### PHP - Hypertext Preprocessor

PHP is a server-side scripting language used to build dynamic web pages. It allows you to interact with databases, process forms, and manage sessions, making it essential for building interactive web applications.

- **Usage**: Used for server-side logic and interactions.
- **Basic Syntax**: PHP code is written within `<?php ?>` tags. For example, `<?php echo "Hello, World!"; ?>` outputs text on the page.
